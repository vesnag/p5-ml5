# p5.js & ml5.js Snippets

This repository contains examples using **p5.js** for creative visuals and **ml5.js** for easy machine learning in the browser.

This repository also includes a script that converts **p5.js** sketches from **global mode** to **instance mode** using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to add the necessary `p.` prefixes.

The site is built using Hugo and is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.
